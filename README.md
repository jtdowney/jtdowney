# Hi, I'm John

I am currently the Chief Information Security Officer at GoFundMe. In my free time, I like to contribute to open source projects and volunteer for organizations like the [Dystonia Medical Research Foundation](https://www.dystonia-foundation.org/) and [FIRST Robotics](https://www.firstinspires.org/).
